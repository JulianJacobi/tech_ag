How to Install tech_ag:

1. You need a Apache2, PHP5 and MYSQL Server (optional a PHPmyAdmin Installation)

2. copy all files to your web folder (on Linux systems in /var/www the default path)

3. insert the *.sql file in the db folder to the Database

4. have fun with the tech_ag website or better the backend/CMS

After the MySQL dump a default user is inserted with all rights:
